Given an adjacency list for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where adj_list[i] contains a list of all vertices j such that there is a directed edge from vertex i to vertex j, with  V  vertices and E  edges, your task is to find any valid topological sorting of the graph.

 

In a topological sort, for every directed edge u -> v,  u must come before v in the ordering.
